      "backstory": "Born in Waterdeep, Rutger was the child of an elven mother and human father. Growing up as a half-elf in a big city, he received a good education and was showered with an abundance of opportunities. Despite this, other children his age would make fun of him and called him weird; he was the certified outsider of his school. He never let it bother him, having his books, screenplays and instruments to keep him company, but deep down his insecurities slowly ate him up. These insecurities fueled a fire in Rutger's hearth, a determination to prove everyone wrong about him. It would drive him to write the greatest legend ever told. \n\nDedicated to his poetry and research and driven by this newly lit fire in his hearth, Rutger decided to attend the College of Lore. After years of studying magic and researching the mysteries of the Forgotten Realms he finally graduated.\n\n\nWith a new affinity for magic and investigation he is now out to look for that legendary adventure to write about.",
      "otherNotes": "NPC's\n\nElincia Valfir (mom)\n\nElincia is a fairly young elven female. She is about 100 years old and in the prime of her life. She used to be the Elven princess of the High Forest wood elves. However one time, when she went on a diplomatic mission to Waterdeep to solidify the relationship between Waterdeep and the wood elves. During this mission she met a handsome  man called Reiner the Reeper, the advisor of the lord of Waterdeep. Elincia fell madly in love with Reiner and once the mission was over, she couldn't resist coming back to Waterdeep to see him. When the elven king found out about this relationship, he was furious. So he gave her a choice: She could either stay with Reiner and give up her rights to the throne, or leave him. As you might have guessed, Elincia chose the first option. Slightly damaging the diplomatic relationship between Waterdeep and the elves but she found something way more valuable. She later married Reiner and gave birth to her precious son Rutger. She currently resides together with Reiner in a mansion in Waterdeep. \n\n\nReiner the Reeper (dad)\n\nReiner is the son of one of the noblemen in Waterdeep. He is a very clever strategist and advisor to the lord of Waterdeep. He made a name for himself when he once rescued the lord from an assasination attempt. Since then he is the most trusted advisor and friend of the lord of Waterdeep. He met his wife Elincia when she visited on a diplomatic mission and married her, like mentioned before. He has also been his son's mentor and idol. He taught his son a lot from his own experiences in the hope that Rutger would reach even further in life than himself. "

While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice\u2019s mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire\u2019s wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed.</p>\r\n<p>The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a sun blade.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>Sunsword</em> is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16.

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See <a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spells Rules</span></a> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=1&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spells Listing</span></a> for the bard spell list.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Cantrips</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\r\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\r\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\r\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>",

The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.<br /><br />An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm\u2019s reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm\u2019s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge.

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p>\r\n<p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature--what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>\r\n<p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>\r\n<p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.</p>\r\n<p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.</p>",

The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).</p>\r\n<p>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>\r\n<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>\r\n<p><strong>At Higher Levels.&nbsp;</strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.</p>",
